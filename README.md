Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the performance of academic programs to support decisions on whether to continue or discontinue specific programs. By collecting historical data over several years—including admission numbers, student retention rates, and graduation rates—we designed Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess program effectiveness.
